/**
 * Crushers
 *
 * Ceiling crushers that cycle between raised and lowered positions, damaging
 * the player when caught underneath.
 *
 * Based on: linuxdoom-1.10/p_ceilng.c:EV_DoCeiling(), T_MoveCeiling()
 * Accuracy: Approximation — same raise-then-crush cycle, but we use linear
 * interpolation instead of DOOM's fixed-point per-tic movement. Damage is
 * applied once per second while crushed (DOOM applies 10 damage per tic-cycle).
 *
 * Visual approach: The renderer groups upper walls belonging to the crusher
 * sector into an animated container that moves between the raised and crushed
 * heights. Ceiling surfaces (if any) are also included.
 *
 * Crusher types:
 * - crushAndRaise: ceiling raises to highest neighbor ceiling, then lowers to
 *   floor + 8, repeating indefinitely. Activated by switch (SR type 63) or
 *   walk-over trigger (W1/WR types 6, 25, 73, 77).
